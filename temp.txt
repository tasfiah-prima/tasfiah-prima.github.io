              My research interests lie in molecular biology, bioinformatics,
              and personalized medicine. I have hands-on experience in various
              laboratory techniques including DNA isolation, PCR, gel
              electrophoresis, bacterial culture, and cell culture techniques.
              My recent training in biosafety and animal cell culture has
              expanded my expertise in BSL-2 laboratory operations.

              Beyond academics, I am actively involved in science communication
              and outreach, having organized the Bangladesh National Science
              Olympiad and hosted various cultural programs. I am passionate
              about advancing scientific research and contributing to the field
              of molecular biology and biotechnology.
